Caution when you update an sqlite database
==========================================

The database changes for this version will require to change the
definition of various columns. This is not easily possible when using
sqlite. Therefore, the affected tables are first renamed, than
new tables with the modified columns are created in the old table
content will be copied into the new table. The old tables will not
be removed and are prefixed with '__'. You may manunally remove them
once you have successfully checked the update.
