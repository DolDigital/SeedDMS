Layout of installation
=======================

SeedDMS allows various kinds of installations with very individual layouts
on disk. The proposed layout till version 5.1.6 was as the following:

seeddms51x ---+--- data
              |
              +--- pear
              |
              +--- seeddms-5.1.x
              |
              +--- www -> seeddms-5.1.x

'data' contains all document files, the sqlite database (if used), the full text
data, the log files, and the cached preview images.

'pear' contains all PEAR packages including the four SeedDMS packages SeedDMS_Core,
SeedDMS_Lucene, SeedDMS_Preview, SeedDMS_SQLiteFTS.

'seeddms-5.1.x' are the sources of seeddms and 'www' being a link on it.

This layout has disadvantages when updating the source of seeddms, because
the directories 'conf' and 'ext' has to be moved from 'seeddms-5.1.x' to
'seeddms-5.1.(x+1)'.

The new layout mostly retains that structure but uses more soft links to place
the local data outside of 'seeddms-5.1.x' which makes updating a lot easier.
As MS Windows does not support soft links, this change will only apply to Linux/Unix
systems. The new layout is the following:

seeddms51x ---+--- data --+-- log
              |           |
              |           +-- ext
              |           |
              |           +-- ...
              |
              +--- pear
              |
              +--- conf
              |
              +--- seeddms-5.1.x
              |
              +--- seeddms -> seeddms-5.1.x
              |
              +--- www --+-- inc -> ../seeddms/inc
                         |
                         +-- op -> ../seeddms/op
                         |
                         +-- out -> ../seeddms/out
                         |
                         +-- views -> ../seeddms/views
                         |
                         +-- controllers -> ../seeddms/controllers
                         |
                         +-- styles -> ../seeddms/styles
                         |
                         +-- languages -> ../seeddms/languages
                         |
                         +-- webdav -> ../seeddms/webdav
                         |
                         +-- restapi -> ../seeddms/restapi
                         |
                         +-- pdfviewer -> ../seeddms/pdfviewer
                         |
                         +-- index.php -> ../seeddms/index.php
                         |
                         +-- ext -> ../data/ext

In order to convert to this layout you need to do the following in the seeddms51x
directory:

ln -s seeddms-5.1.x seeddms
mv www/conf .
mv www/ext data
rm www
mdkir www
cd www
ln -s ../seeddms/inc
ln -s ../seeddms/op
ln -s ../seeddms/out
ln -s ../seeddms/views
ln -s ../seeddms/controllers
ln -s ../seeddms/styles
ln -s ../seeddms/languages
ln -s ../seeddms/webdav
ln -s ../seeddms/restapi
ln -s ../seeddms/pdfviewer
ln -s ../seeddms/index.php
ln -s ../data/ext
